## How to perform one action on multiple DID’s in one go?

Editing all the DIDs one by one may feel like a tedious task. That's why Connex has introduced a functionality where you can perform the same action over multiple DID’s in one go.

1)	Login to your Connex account and from the side menu, extend the "Management" menu item and look for "DID". 

2)	Click on it and you will open a new page showing the existing DIDs.

3)	Select all the DIDs, on which you want to perform the same action and click on "Edit Selected Items". 

4)	A new form will open, perform the changes and click on "Save".

This is how the bulk action on multiple DIDs is performed in one go.
