# Difference

Having 2 seperate systems synchronised is not trival matter even if the 2 systems are designed for that very purpose.
It is normal for there to be slight variations between stats and CDR's, but there are acceptable tollerances, this is known in the telecoms
industry and there is error margin added to profits, etc to compensate.

## Channels
There are many variables that are used in calculating channels and latency in reporting figures from 1 side to the other. Most UI's which
report channels also have intrinsic latency as the data is passed from the dialog variables to the UI.

- A ConnexCS Channel represents a bi-directional (2) audio streams.
- A channel represents ANY dialog state post routing-engine (this includes, pre-ring, ringing, connected and teardown).
  - There may be a latent affect of comparing this between servers.
