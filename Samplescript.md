Sample scripts are available on our GitHub repository under example applications. Let's discuss some scripts briefly.

Examples of Sample Scripts
account-jump.js: With the use of this function, a call that is received via a "shared" CLI can be routed to the Class 5 system, pretending to be from a separate customer. A pre-entered CLI will be used to select the customer. The system can then be used for pinless calling card services. 
api.js: The code attempts to get the customer object from the  API.
asrplus-faster-call-fail.js: ConnexCS's ASRPlus functionality minimizes unnecessary attempts and expedites call failures. It works best for heavy traffic profiles like in call centers.
better-date-time-restriction.js: Allows customers to make calls with certain restrictions with time and days.
 dnc-add.js: Adds a number to the DNC list.
dnc-check.js: Reads the number of a person on the DNC list.
email.js: The code is a function that sends an email to people.
outbound-honeypot.js: Checks if the destination number has been blocked.
simple-calling-card.js: Answers the call and asks the user for a phone number to dial. The call then gets sent out through egress routes on the same account.
