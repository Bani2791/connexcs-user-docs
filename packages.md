# Packages

A package is a representation of a product/service that you are offering to your customers. It can be a chargable item which is recurring based on your required interval.
A package is created as a global entity in the system, then allocated to each customer as required. You may wish to do this for any MRC such as DIDs, rental of a phone system or other hardware.

## Minimum Spend
If you bill your customers for a minimum spend per month based on minutes consumption, you can set a package to have a minimum cost. At the recurrance interval it will calculate the spend of the customer for the previous interval, subtract that from the minimum spend and then pass charge that to their account.

This tutorial will guide you through managing packages. Access the packages section from the setup menu, as shown in the screenshot below.
