# How to perform one action on multiple DID’s in one go?

Editing all the DID one by one might feel like a time taking task. That's why Connex has introduced a functionality where you can perform the same action over multiple DID’s in one go.

1)	Login to your Connexaccount and from the side menu, extend the "Management" menu item and look for "DID".

This is how the bulk action on multiple DIDs is performed in one go.
