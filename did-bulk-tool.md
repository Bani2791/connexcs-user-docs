# How to perform one action on multiple DID’s in one go?

Editing all the DID one by one might feel like a time taking task. That's why Connex has introduced a functionality where you can perform the same action over multiple DID’s in one go.

1)	Login to your Connexaccount and from the side menu, extend the "Management" menu item and look for "DID". 
 
2)	Click on it and you would be landed on a new page showing you the existing DIDs.
 
3)	Select all the DIDs, onwhich you want to perform the same action on and click on "Edit Selected Items". 
 
4)	A new form would open, perform the changes and click on "Save".
 
This is how the bulk action on multiple DIDs is performed in one go.
