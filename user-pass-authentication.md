<h2>Username Password Authentication</h2>

ConnexCS supports two varieties of authentication. IP which only checks the originating IP address, and Username / Password Authentication, which allows any IP address to be used and required authentication information to be included in the SIP headers. This is usually done on softphones, but it can be configured on diallers which have dynamic IP addresses.
