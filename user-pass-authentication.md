<h2>Username Password Authentication</h2>

ConnexCS supports two varieties of authentication. IP which only checks the originating IP address, and Username / Password Authentication, which allows any IP address to be used and required authentication information to be included in the SIP headers. This is usually done on softphones, but it can be configured on diallers which have dynamic IP addresses.
Setup

    Go to the customer you wish to add an account for [Management > Customers > [Customer Name]]
    Click on Auth.
    Click on + under User / Pass Auth
    Fill in a UNIQUE username, this must be unique across all the accounts on your system, we recommend a numeric username.
    Fill in a password.
    The remaining fields are optional.
    Click Save.

You can enter these credentials on to your softphone or dialler and register against your connexcs server ip address.

Server IP can be found under Setup> My Servers> IP address
