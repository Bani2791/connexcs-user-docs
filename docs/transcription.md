Global :material-menu-right: Transcription

## Introduction

!!! danger "Alpha Feature"
    Transcription is currently in public Alpha, it's not intended for production usage and has limited documentation, we are working on this.

A transcription service translates voice communication whether live or recorded into a text. If you have a recorded call, you may use this service to have it transcribed in English.

English is the only language offered at present, however, additional languages can be made available as per the customer's request.

Depending on the needs of customers, you can define individual prices. You can also select the quantity you want to offer your customer.

## Transcription Setup

### Enable Transcription
To enable the Transcription feature on your account navigate to Setup :material-menu-right: Settings :material-menu-right: Account and click the "Enable Transcription" button.

### Create a Transcription Package
To create a package to resell to your customers go to Config :material-menu-right: [Packages](https://docs.connexcs.com/customer/package/). Click on <img width="20" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113333073/196905493-763b9c09-c358-482e-bd4e-1b4a60e3b222.png"> and choose your Transcription Package from **ConnexCS Package**.

Select your **Retail Cost** and click on <img width="40" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113333073/196905997-4050eeef-4387-4718-84cb-e390be97d987.png">

### Automated Transcriptions
Add Package to Customers Account, assign the **Quantity**, and also assign a **Start Date** and **End date** to the package. At the End Date, the package will automatically cease to work.

In Routing :material-menu-right: Media, you can enable or disable this service.

### Manual Transcriptions

Navigate to the **Logging Page** to access the transcribed calls.


## Analyzing Transcriptions

Once a call has been transcribed it is placed into a full-text search engine, available only to you and (in the future) your customer.

To analyze the transcriptions we will be sending a query to the server which will then based upon your search criteria return results with a score.

### Ad-hoc Queries

To view existing transcriptions, you can enter `*` and choose the required date range, and it will return all the results. 

You can further refine your search using query Search Modifiers (anchor) 

### Saved Queries   

Saved queries allows you to build a query which you can reuse.

The **Transcription Query Profile** enables you to construct a query list and save it. 

You can search the created query list for the calls that have been transcribed.

### Score

When you search for a trancribed call, it assigns score to the calls.

The highest score will be alloted to the most relevant call. 

The maximum number of words matched from the query with the transcribed call will have the highest score.  

### Transcription

Click on **View Transcription** to view the full transcribed call.

> **_NOTE:_** 
> 1. Transcription will be performed only for the recorded calls.   

#### Visibility

Visibility is a privacy setting which allows you to decide if you want your customers to be able to see (and use) the query which you have saved. **Public** will allow your customers to see this, **Private** will keep it hidden from them.

You should choose **Customer Name** as **None** and **Visibility** as **Public** if you want every one of your customers to see the list.

### Transcription Alerts

!!! danger "Coming Soon"
    Alert system for Transcription is currently in development stage, it has limited documentation, we are working on this.

You can navigate to a specific customer's account and add a Saved Query as alert.

You will either recieve a call or text or e-mail saying a particular word or phrase has been detected for a specific call.  

#### Penalty

You can set a Penalty for a customer.

For example, you can disable the customer's account if someone used swear words over the call. 

You can decide the time-duration of the penalty.

#### **Lemmentization**  

Our built-in search engine offers lemmentization. 

Lemmatization is the grouping together of different forms of the same word. It enables end users to use any variation of a base word in search queries.  

It helps in receiving appropriate results. 

For example, 

1. runs, running, ran are all forms of the word **run**
2. builds, building or builtÂ are all forms of the word **build**


## Search Modifiers

Search modifications allow you to describe what you want to find. There is a specific syntax to help you with this.
