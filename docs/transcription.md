## Transcription Search Box

The Transcription Search Box allows you to search for the transcribed call. You can use **Search Modifiers** to simplify and expedite the search process. Search modifications allow you to search for specific data and improve the accuracy of your searches. Let’s talk about the modifiers that might help you look through your call transcripts. 

**1.** **Wildcard Searches**

In a search query, wildcards can be used in place of one or more characters. When searching for a single character, a question mark (?) is used. For searching with several characters, use an asterisk (). When looking for alternative spellings and variations of a root word, wildcards are employed. Word roots must contain at least three letters before a wildcard. Wildcard characters cannot be used in place of a word’s first letter or within an exact phrase search. For example, if you write wom?n, this will search words like women, woman, etc. Another example is if you search bird, this will feed you with results like bird, birding, birdman etc.

**2.** **Regular Expressions**

Regular expression is an advanced tool useful for finding patterns in various sequences of characters. It does not work with specific terms or phrases. Regular expressions can be used to match patterns in data. By using operators as placeholder characters, patterns can be identified. Regular expressions patterns can be used in the query string by enclosing them in forward slashes ("/"). Some of the Regular Expressions are discussed as follows:
* this is text : It exactly matches the “this is text” text
