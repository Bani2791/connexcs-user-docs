* Dates are displayed top-left.  The first is for the start date, the second is for the end date, and entering both establishes a range of dates instead of one day.  Clicking on either will display a selection calendar where you can select dates and times, or you can enter each of these parameters manually.
* The dropdown menus to the right of the dats is for customers, providers, and groups (if any).  They are in alphabetical order, and you can select more than one group where applicable.  Parameters are removed by clicking the `x` right next to its name.
* There are also **Select All** and **Select None** options.
* After you've entered parameters press the refresh button at the top right beneath the section row.  We advise against using the browsers refresh button, as this may also reset the parameters of the report.
