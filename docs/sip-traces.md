##About SIP Tracing
SIP Tracing is a mechanic found in phone systems that use the Session Initiation Protocol (which is most VoIP systems), for interactions like Trunks and endpoints. Traces give detailed information about calls and call attempts, which helps providers identify any problem areas for debugging and troubleshooting.
