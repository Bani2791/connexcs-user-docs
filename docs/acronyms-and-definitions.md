|**ALOC**|**Average Length of Call**|See ACD.|
|**ASR**|**Answer Seisure Ratio**|The call success rates for a given system, weighing answered calls versus total calls.|  
|**CPS**|**Calls Per Second**|The volume of calls, usually referring to how many calls can be handled per second, rather than how many a system can recieve.|
