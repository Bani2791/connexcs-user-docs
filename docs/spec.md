# SBC or Class 4 Softswitch

**ConnexCS** is a Class 4 Cloud-based Softswitch. It is delivered as a service, as in **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**. It allows our clients to deploy a massively-scalable distributed system accross the globe with minimal technical expertise.

## SBC, Class 4 Softswitch, Proxy?

We have given extensive consideration whether to brand our system as a Class 4 cloudswitch or an **SBC (Session Border Controller)**. 
As our platform is delivered OTT (Over The Top), sitting on cloud architecture, the typical Border part of the Session Border Controller is blurred. An SBC is almost always a Class 4 switch; however, a Class 4 switch does not have to be a SBC. You can also deploy class 5 switches or your dialers to communicate using our Class 4 Switch.
