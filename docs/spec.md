# Class 4 Softswitch

**ConnexCS** is a Class 4 Cloud-based Softswitch (software switch). This means the call never terminates with the **ConnexCS** system, the platform only handles call routing. Class 5 switches perform call termination functions such as answering calls, playing messages, and more.

**ConnexCS** is delivered as a service, more precisely as a **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**, which enables clients to deploy a massively-scalable distributed system across the globe with minimal technical expertise.

!!! **Question:** "SBC, Class 4 Softswitch, or Proxy?"-
    We've given extensive consideration whether to brand our system as a Class 4 cloudswitch or an **SBC (Session Border Controller)**. The typical Border part of the Session Border Controller is blurred because our platform is delivered OTT (Over The Top), sitting on cloud architecture. 
 An SBC is almost always a Class 4 switch; but, a Class 4 switch does'nt have to be an SBC. You can also deploy Class 5 switches or your dialers to communicate using our Class 4 Switch.
