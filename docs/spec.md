# Class 4 Softswitch

**ConnexCS** is a Class 4 Cloud-based Softswitch. This means the call never terminates with the **ConnexCS** system, the platform only handles call routing. Answering calls, playing messages, etc are all functions of call termination which is performed by Class 5 switches. **ConnexCS** is delivered as a service, or specifically a **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**, which allows our clients to deploy a massively-scalable distributed system accross the globe with minimal technical expertise.

!!! question "SBC, Class 4 Softswitch, or Proxy?"
    We have given extensive consideration whether to brand our system as a Class 4 cloudswitch or an **SBC (Session Border Controller)**. As our platform is delivered OTT (Over The Top), sitting on cloud architecture, the typical Border part of the Session Border Controller is blurred. An SBC is almost always a Class 4 switch; however, a Class 4 switch does not have to be a SBC. You can also deploy Class 5 switches or your dialers to communicate using our Class 4 Switch.
