# Rate Card Profits

Now, you can manage customer rate card profits by tagging the profits as:
* **Profit** - the profit applied when a customer rate card is built.
* **Remove** - remove a profit setup from a rate card.
* **Blocked** - stops calls from going through a destination.

After logging into the dashboard, click **Rate Card**.
