# SIP Profile

**Setup :material-menu-right: Config :material-menu-right: SIP Profile**

In simple terms, you can think of SI Profile as a way to group a lot of users together. These users will have common features and services to use when they login with the SIP Profile.

For example, there is a call center with 100 agents and an operator too. So, the operator might require some extra features than the agents. The feature might include listening to the calls or dial certain numbers with the agents aren't allowed to. Thus, the operator might want to have a different SIP Profile.

When someone logs into the [Web Phone](https://docs.connexcs.com/webphone/), they login through their **SIP Profile**. They login with the **SIP User Authentication**.

## Steps to setup the SIP Profile

1. Go to Setup :material-menu-right: Config :material-menu-right: SIP Profile** and you will see a screen as shown below. Then claick the `+` button.
2. A window will appear after you click on the `+` button. It will let you create a new SIP Profile. As you can see the window has 3 fields for detting up the SIP Profile.
