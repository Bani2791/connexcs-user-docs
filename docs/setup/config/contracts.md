# Contracts
Setup :material-menu-right: Config :material-menu-right: Contracts

Allowing ConnexCS to manage your contracts increases integration and compliance by only allowing your customers to dial if they have approved a contract.

You can also restrict dialling by a customer automatically if they have not approved a contract before the grade period ends.

Contracts are immutable, meaning that you nor the customer are allowed to change a contract once it has been set, but you can issue a new contract which would
require the customer to sign again.

## Create a Contract

1. Click on the :fontawesome-plus: button.
2. Give the contract a name.
3. Click on the contract you have just made.
4. Click on :fontawesome-plus: button to add a revision.
5. Paste your contract in plain text.

## Adding a contract to a customer

1. Goto Management :material-menu-right: Customer :material-menu-right: [Your Customer] :material-menu-right: Contracts :fontawesome-plus:
2. Select a contract (The most recent revision will be choosen automatically)
3. Optionally choose a grace date and if the contract is required to be signed.

If a *grace date* is set and & *required* is ticked, the customer's account will remain active untill the date set.
At which point the contract needs to be signed or the account will be suspended.

!!! warning
	"Signing" of a contract is the user inputting their name into a text box. We perform no further checking of this, nor to we make
	any claim that our system is provable in court. If you wish for a more robust verification system we recommend you use a dedicated
	online signature system, we can assist with the integration if required.
