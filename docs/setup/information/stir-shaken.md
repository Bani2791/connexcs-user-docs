**Setup :material-menu-right: Information :material-menu-right: STIR/SHAKEN Cert**

The **STIR/SHAKEN Cert** is a necessary prerequisite step for call origination providers to adopt in order to authenticate telephone calls in the future. The adoption of this standard is intended to eventually help mitigate spoofing and robocalling, and other nuisance and scam calls. For more detailed information, see our article [**FCC Regulations Regarding Robocalling (TRACED Act)**](/guides/stir-shaken-fcc). 

ConnexCS does not provide the STIR/SHAKEN Certificate, it must be obtained from a designated authority, such as Ofcom or FCC (for the FCC, this began June 30, 2021). Once you have the certificate, it can be added to ConnxCS per the steps below.
