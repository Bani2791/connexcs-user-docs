The **STIR/SHAKEN Cert** is a necessary prerequisite step for call origination providers to adopt to authenticate telephone calls in the future. The adoption of this standard eventually helps to mitigate spoofing and robocalling, and other nuisance and scam calls. For more detailed information, see our article [**FCC Regulations Regarding Robocalling (TRACED Act)**](/guides/stir-shaken-fcc).

ConnexCS doesn't provide the STIR/SHAKEN Certificate, you must obtain it from a designated authority, such as Ofcom or FCC (for the FCC, this began June 30, 2021). Once you have the certificate, it's added to ConnexCS as per the steps below.
