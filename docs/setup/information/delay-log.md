# Delay Log
**Setup :material-menu-right: Information :material-menu-right: Delay Log**

The **Delay Log** shows all the save-events which have been delayed and when they will be expected to be executed. These events are created when the **`Delay Save`** option is used when saving settings. 

## Save Options

**Save and Continue** = Exit the Customer screen

**Save and Stay** = Save the customer, but stay in the screen (helpful when adding multiple Customers at a time)

**Delay and Save** = Select a time to elapse before saving the Customer, delaying the setup or change. 

!!! example
    A customer calls you and says that they are currently unable to top-up as they are not by their computer. They request $25.00 credit to cover them for the next 1 hour. You can change their debit limit to $25.00 in the system, then immediately after use **`Delay Save`** to change it to $0.00 with a delay of 1 hour. After that 1 hour has passed the customer's limit will automatically be set back to $0.00.
