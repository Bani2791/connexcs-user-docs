A delay event allows you delay the commitment of a record until a later date/time.

You can delay the saving of a record by clicking on the :fontawesome-chevron-down: icon next to the save button and select "Delay Save",
you can then choose for how long wish for the event to be delayed.

The Delay Log page shows all the save-events which have been delayed and when they will be expected to be executed.

!!! example
	A customer calls you and says that they are currently unable to top-up as they are not by their computer.
	They request $25.00 credit to cover them for the next 1 hour.
	You can change their debit limit to $25.00 in the system, then immediately after change it to $0.00 and use the delay save.
	In the delay, you can choose 1 hour. After that 1 hour has passed the customers limit will automatically be set back to $0.00
