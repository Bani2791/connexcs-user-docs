# Reporting a Problem
This page covers the best practices for reporting problems to ConnexCS support.  We encourage feedback, but want to make sure you have the most efficient means of expressing a problem so there are no holdups.

!!! tip "ConnexCS System Status"
    Before reporting a problem, please check the [ConnexCS System Status Page](https://status.connexcs.com/) for current known issues. 

**One Problem Policy**

If you have more than one problem to report, we ask:

1. Create a separate ticket for each request.  This so that the individual concerns get routed to the correct staff.
2. Allow an adequate amount of time for us to assess the problem and resolve it.  We first have to assess if the problems are connected, adding extra time onto finding the roots themselves.
3. Call instead of emailing.  This is so we can get a concise reading on all concerns quickly and ask follow-up questions on the spot.

## Support Channels
Below is a list of channels you can use to reach us.

### Online Chat

Online chat is real-time assistance that is useful when you're not in a position to call.  The blue help icon at the bottom of this page will lead you to a chat window.  Clicking this button alerts staff, and the first person to become available will reply as soon as possible.  We find that most questions get resolved efficiently this way. Please note that the chat system is for one-on-one communication about a specific problem, not for multiple concerns or system-wide change requests. 

### Tickets

Support tickets are created by clicking the Safety Ring icon in the top-right of the dashboard.

### Phone

If you wish to speak to a real person you can call our office number listed on our main website. Our support line WILL contact engineers (and wake them up) 24/7. We kindly ask that you only ring this number during 9:00am - 23:00pm GMT, unless there is a CRITICAL issue.

## Issue Severity

We classify issues into the following categories:

1. **Trivial**- Aesthetic unpleasantries, or things that don't interrupt day to day activities.
2. **Important** - Specific settings can't be changed, or set correctly. But not interrupting calls.
3. **Critical** - Calls cannot be made, it's seriously affecting call flow.

## Required Information

When reporting a problem it is important to provide us with the following information:

### Documentation

Our onsite documentation has a two-fold purpose:

* To provide a repository where you can search for information relevant to your problem.
* To inform your questions when you contact support.

Sometimes a complication is just a matter of turning off parameters that aren't compatible.  These are instances where a little troubleshooting might solve it.  There are other times where a bit of help is needed as well, and understanding the documentation will speed our efforts to remedy larger concerns. 
 
### User Interface Issue

Including a screenshot along with a clear description of the problem can really help us understand what needs to be resolved.  For an efficient utility to take UI screenshots, we recommend a browser plugin called "Lightshot", or use your OS's built-in snipping tool.

### Problems with Calls

For problems with call flow, the **Call-ID** is how we identify which calls are affected.  It helps us isolate customers, providers, and/or channels that may be affected.  Call-ID is found in the **Logging** section by clicking on a call, and then copying the ID to right of the panel.

### Clear and Concise

All of the above steps contain more ways for you to be able to identify your problem, troubleshoot it, and then communicate the problem(s) clearly in the event of contact.

### Lastly

We are also happy to talk with you about wider SIP topics outside of our switch where possible, however we do not tolerate rude behaviour, intimidation or threats.  We are all SSVVP and SSCA qualified, and whenever possible, we will cite references or point you to SIP traces for fact-checking information.
