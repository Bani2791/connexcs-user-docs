!!! warning "Using Multiple Conditions"
    Apps are limited to a single Condition. Multiple Conditions in an App will cause it to fail.  
    
## Advanced Applications
To configure more complex applications, ConnexCS offers Class5 **[Programmable Voice](https://docs.connexcs.com/developers/scriptforge/#class-5-programmable-voice)** which allows you to build comprehensive applications using JavaScript.
