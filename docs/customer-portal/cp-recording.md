# Recording

The **Recording** area provides an opportunity to listen to recorded calls, providing this feature is available on your account.

1. Under **Path**, select the date (YYYY-MM-DD format) to inspect.

2. This will list all recordings on that date.
3. You can identify specific calls two ways:
    + **Path**: Use the Call-ID which can be found in [**Latest Calls**](cp-latest-calls.md)).
    + **Last Modified**: If there are not many calls, you may be able to find it by looking for the time the call ended. This is less conclusive than the using the Call-ID, especially when there are many calls. 
5. Select **Download** or **Play Audio** to access the recording. 
6. Select **`Back`** to go back to the list of dates.
