# Breakout
The **Breakout** report lists account customers with associated profits, and relevant data such as how much each customer costs, how much they have been charged, ASR and ACD, and so on. The information here is from processed CDR and so is considered "billing accurate", meaning this data can be used to bill customers. 

+ Toggle **Group Destination** to show calls based on the destnation number
