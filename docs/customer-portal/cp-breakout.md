# Breakout
The **Breakout** report lists account customers with the following: 
 -  associated profits, and 
 -  relevant data such as cost per customer, amount billed, Aggregation Services Router (ASR) and Automatic Call Distribution Service (ACD). The information here is  from processed Call Detail Record (CDR) and is therefore considered "billing accurate". This data can be used to bill customers.   
    

 Toggle **Group Destination** to show calls based on the destination number.  
 Use the **`Date`** and **`Select Destination`** fields at the top of the page to filter results. 

!!! **Warning:** "Group Destination toggle"-
    Currently, this toggle feature is still under development, so may generate an error.
