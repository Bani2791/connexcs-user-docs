# CLI

**CLI (Caller Line Identification)** (or "Automatic Number Identification") refers to *From* header in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and represents the senders number in an outgoing telephone call. It's the technical term for the Caller ID mechanism. 

In VoIP systems, CLI is more than just a way to display the number of incoming calls. It serves as a defense against unidentified call attempts, provides information to sort incoming calls, and is an important part of billing. On our platform, CLI allows you to restrict and allow CLIs, which then allows or restricts calls based on the match. 

!!! tip "CLI Best Practice"
  It's recommended to have one Forced CLI.

## Forced
Depending on how you want to route the calls, toggle a CLI between `Forced` and `Whitelist`. 

+ **Forced**: If there is no match when you select Forced, the CLI listed is used to replace the CLI being sent on a call. For example, if the CLI is set to 111111111111, that's what is sent on any outbound calls, regardless of what's provisioned on your endpoint.
+ **Whitelist**: Setting to Whitelist will allow a call if there are no specific matches. 

!!! tip "Adding CLIs"
    If you want to add CLIs from the Customer Portal, please contact support to have "Approved CLIs Only" enabled. Any CLI you add will need to be approved before it is functional here.
