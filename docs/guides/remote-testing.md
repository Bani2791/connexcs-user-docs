# Remote Testing

**Remote Testing** using the Weylon application allows for increased visibility into customer issues. The process consists of 3 steps.

!!! note "Testing Results"
    Reports for data visualization  of test results are currently in development.
    
## Provision Test

First, provision the desired test in the ConnexCS Control Panel. Go to **Global :material-menu-right: Weylon**. This will list any existing tests.

**Create Test Configuration**

Click the **:material-plus:** to create a new testing configuration. 

+ **Name**: Name the new test, ideally something descriptive so you know what it will test
+ **ID**: This is randomly generated by the system 
+ **Show Output**: When **Enabled**, it will display real-time results while the tests are running on the customer equipment. When **Disabled**, a progress bar is displayed, so there isn't confusion about what all the results mean while the test is still running. 

**Add Criteria**

Next to **Criteria**, click the **:material-plus:** to specify the test parameters

+ **Type**: Select to run Ping, Simulate Media, or Trace Route
+ **Host**: Specify the IP or FQDN
+ **Level**: There are 3 options to choose from which will vary the intensity of the test:
    + Basic- single, quick test
    + Standard- captures moderate amount of data without being too detailed
    + Advanced- detailed soak test which can last several minutes

**Save work**

+ Click **`Save`** for the Criteria. Add additional test Criteria as needed. 
+ Click **`Save`** to complete the test setup. 


## Customer Setup
Next, the customer will need to install Weylon on their Linux machine. 

**Install the application**


```
wget https://app.connexcs.com/files/weylon

chmod +x ./weylon
```


**Execute the test**

```
./weylon -i ABCD
```

## View Results
All test results will report back to your Control Panel under **Global :material-menu-right: Weylon**.
