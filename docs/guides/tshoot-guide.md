# Troubleshooting Guide
When troubleshooting VoIP and general telephony issues, it is helpful to understand some of the basic technical concepts. We can use this knowledge to then narrow our troubleshooting efforts by determining what type of issue the customer is experiencing. 

## Calling Issues
See our [**Troubleshoot Signalling**](/docs/guides/tshoot-signal.md) guide.

## Call Quality issues
See our [**Troubleshoot Media**](/docs/guides/tshoot-media.md) guide.

## Billing issues
These issues are typically due to an issue with the carrier or with how ConnexCS has been configured by the customer.
