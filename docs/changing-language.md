# Changing the Language of Text Displayed on the UI

You can change the language of the text displayed on the ConnexCS Control Panel's UI, if you want to see text in your preferred language.

!!! question "Will this change the language for every word on the UI" 
    Changing the language on the Control Panel's UI using only this workflow does not change the language for every word you see on the UI. To view more or all words in your preferred language, you must go to Setup > Advanced > Language and enter the non-English equivalents for the words you want to see in your preferred language.

To change the language on the Control Panel's UI:

1.  Log into the ConnexCS Control Panel.
    
    ConnexCS Control Panel displays the page you were on when you logged out of the Control Panel.
    
2.  Click the down-arrow next to your name (located at the top-right corner of the page).
    
    A task menu appears.
    
3.  Click `Change Language`.
    
    The Change Language pop-up appears.
    
4.  Select a language from the drop-down list.
    
    You can select one of the following languages: اللغة العربية (Arabic), Deutsch (German) English, Español (Spanish), Francias (French), हिन्दी (Hindi, one of the official languages in India), 日本語 (Japanese), Kanuri (a dialect continuum spoken in Africa), Português (Portuguese), Русский (Russian), తెలుగు (Telugu, a language spoken in some Indian states), اردو (Urdu), and 中文 (Chinese).
    
5.  Click `Update`.
    
    ConnexCS Control Panel immediately displays most of the text in your preferred language, on the UI.
