!!! question "Will this change the language for every word on the UI?" 
    Modifying the language here will change most, but not all, of the words in the Control Panel. To modify existing translated words, and to add your own, go to Setup > Advanced > [Language](https://docs.connexcs.com/setup/advanced/language/).

## Change the language on the Control Panel's UI

1. Click the down-arrow next to your name (located at the top-right corner of the page).    
3. Select `Change Language`.
4. Select a language from the drop-down list.   
5. Click `Update`.
6. The ConnexCS Control Panel UI immediately displays most of the text in your preferred language.
