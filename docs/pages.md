 

## Introduction

Using Page Builder, you can customize the Control Panel, Customer Portal, and Web Phone. Pages help you enhance the functionality of these interfaces. 

You can add Pages to multiple areas of these interfaces, such as Carrier, Customers, and Rate cards. 

A page can be interactive, containing forms that can be completed and then processed by ScriptForge.

ℹ️: **Pages work together with [Button Builder](https://docs.connexcs.com/developers/button-builder/) to display a page on any Navigation bars.**

The **Elements** in the Pages are extremely powerful and increase flexibility for the features you want to include in your portal.

### Usage Cases

1. For displaying any rules or manuals to the customers, you can use Pages to redirect to these manuals or rulebooks.  
2. Interaction with external links using [**Scriptforge**] (https://docs.connexcs.com/developers/scriptforge/) and integrate with Pages. 
3. You can use it for creating interactive content. For example, getting input from the customers.  
4. Server-side and client-side validation.  
5. If you are using **Webphone**, the data can be collected in the form created in Pages.
6. Customers may create their own payment processors. They can create their own interface using Pages. The integration of the processing system can be done using Scriptforge.  
7. Number Porting: You can create a form (using Pages) on the Customer Portal and ask for details; once the form is submitted, the requests reach Scriptforge for validation purposes. Scriptforge can update the customer on their request processing.
