## Timezone
CDR's are rated and stored in UTC, daily totals are also calculated in UTC. You can change the timezone that individual CDR records are viewed from the timezone selector, however downloads will always be in UTC.

## Archived Records
CDR records are "hot" (instantly queryable) for the last 3 months guaranteed. After this they will be moved to our warm storage server where they are highly compressed and available for bulk download.
