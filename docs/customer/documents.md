# Documents

The **Documents** section is used to collect various files from the customer. Some examples are CLI verification, copy of a phone bill, or some means to verify identity such as a passport. Creating and saving a new entry here will send an alert to the customer letting them know they need to provide the requested document.  This can be uploaded from the customer site, then accessed here for review.
