# Class5

**Class5** is the ConnexCS Unified Communications service. There are several functions which customers may configure: 

+ [**Apps**](https://docs.connexcs.com/class5/apps/) allows customers to configure various features such as Pinless calling, DNC (Do Not Call) lists with the full functionality of Script Forge.
+ [**Conference Calling**](https://docs.connexcs.com/creating-conference/) allows multiple callers to join one call.
+ [**IVRs**](https://docs.connexcs.com/creating-ivr/) present callers with various options for call routing.
+ [**Group call routing**](https://docs.connexcs.com/creating-group/) to distribute inbound calls to a set team.
+ [**Voicemail**](https://docs.connexcs.com/class5/voicemail/) can be managed remotely under specific customers or in a bulk view under **Class5** > **Voicemail**. 
+ **Phonebook** can be setup so all users in a customer receive the same list of numbers within the customer, essentially a company directory. This is also used by [Web Phone](https://docs.connexcs.com/setup/integrations/webphone/).
