**Class5** features are the ConnexCS Unified Communications Service (UCS) package. While the majority of the ConnexCS system is centered around Class4 routing, this area provides several functions for customers to configure for better user experience.  

[**Apps**](https://docs.connexcs.com/class5/apps/) allows customers to configure various features such as Pinless Calling or DNC (Do Not Call) lists with the full functionality of Script Forge. This is configured in **Class5** > **Apps**. 


[**Conference**](https://docs.connexcs.com/creating-conference/) allows multiple callers to join one conference call, or bridge.


[**IVR**](https://docs.connexcs.com/creating-ivr/) presents callers with a menu and options for call routing.


[**Groups**](https://docs.connexcs.com/creating-group/) allows you to distribute inbound calls to a predefined team.


[**Voicemail**](https://docs.connexcs.com/class5/voicemail/) is managed under specific customers or in a bulk view under **Class5** > **Voicemail**. 


[**Phonebook**](https://docs.connexcs.com/class5/phonebook/) allows all users to receive the same list of numbers within the customer, essentially a company directory.
