# DID

**Direct Inward Dial (DID)** numbers allow inbound calls to bypass a PBX or other routing to connect directly to the destination number. 

Create and edit **DID (Direct Inward Dial)** parameters within the individual customer cards, either using bulk uploads and edits or manually. These can also be managed for multiple customers under the **Global** > **DID** section. 

Use the Stats button to view the **Per Number Report**.

!!! tip "DID Billing"
    For DID billing (located at Customer > DID > Edit DID > Billing), it is recommended to set customers to a Package rather than using the Cost and Retail functions
