# DID

**Direct Inward Dial (DID)** numbers allow inbound calls to bypass a PBX or other routing to connect directly to the destination number. 

Create and edit **DID (Direct Inward Dial)** parameters within the individual customer cards, either using bulk uploads and edits or manually. 

!!! note "Global DID"
    DID may also be configured and managed for specific Customers or Carriers under **Global :material-menu-right: DID**, which displays all configured DID.

Use the Stats button to view the **Per Number Report**.

!!! tip "DID Billing"
    For DID billing (located at Customer > DID > Edit DID > Billing), it is recommended to set customers to a Package rather than using the Cost and Retail functions
