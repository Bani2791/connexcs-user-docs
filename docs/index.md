ConnexCS User Documentation
========================


Welcome to the **Connex Carrier Services (ConnexCS) User Documentation**. The documentation will take you through the different aspects of the **ConnexCS app**.

The guide is divided with tabs based on the different products and services we offer - CloudSwitch, Customer Portal, WebPhone. You can switch between these tabs from the top menu bar.
 
The CloudSwitch guide starts with a quick **starter guide**(https://docs.connexcs.com/getting-started/) to help you onboard successfully and then moves towards the features and functionalities of the app.

If you are looking for a specific topic, you can simply type it in the search bar present in the top-right corner of this screen or use the content menu on the left side. 
 
In case an article does not answer the question you are looking for, you can always get in touch with us directly using the chatbot available on the ConnexCS homepage. You can learn more about our **support system here**(https://docs.connexcs.com/reporting-problems/).   

We hope this guide serves you well. We would love to hear your suggestions and inputs on this guide if any!
