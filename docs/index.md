ConnexCS User Documentation
========================

Welcome to the Connex Carrier Services User Documentation.  If you are new to ConnexCS we recommend taking a look at the **[Getting Started Guides]**.  They will walk you through the **Dashboard**, our equivalent to the home screen.  

There are many branching options for each possible mechanism in the system, so we encourage requests for documentation if a subject needs more attention. More than a repository for troubleshooting help, our reference documentation helps customers who want to make sure they ask the right questions if a problem warrants a call.  As our system evolves with newer versions and updates, we will continue to update the corresponding documentation to meet its level of usability.
