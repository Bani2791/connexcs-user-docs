ConnexCS User Documentation
========================

Welcome to the **Connex Carrier Services User Documentation**. If you are new to ConnexCS, we recommend to start with the **[Getting Started Guides](https://docs.connexcs.com/getting-started/)**. From there, take a quick look at the [**Dashboard overview**](https://docs.connexcs.com/dashboard/), which details the ConnexCS home screen.  

See the [**Video Guide**](https://docs.connexcs.com/video-guide/) for more information and walkthroughs on standard functions on the system. 

The remaining documentation covers all aspects of setup, configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting. It's not only a repository for troubleshooting help, but also serves as reference documentation to help customers ask the right questions if a problem requires a call or support ticket.

With newer versions and updates, we will continue to update the corresponding documentation. You can submit a documentation request if you feel that a subject needs more attention.
