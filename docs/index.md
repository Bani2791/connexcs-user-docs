ConnexCS User Documentation
========================

Welcome to the **Connex Carrier Services User Documentation**.  If you are new to ConnexCS, we recommend beginning with at the **[Getting Started Guides](https://docs.connexcs.com/getting-started/)**. From there, take  quick look at the [**Dashboard** overivew](https://docs.connexcs.com/dashboard/), the equivalent to the ConnexCS home screen.  

See the [Video Guide](https://docs.connexcs.com/video-guide/) for information additional walkthroughs on standard functions on the system. 

The remainder of the documentation is not only a repository for troubleshooting help, but also serves as reference documentation to help customers who want to make sure they ask the right questions if a problem warrants a call.  As our system evolves with newer versions and updates, we will continue to update the corresponding documentation. We encourage requests for documentation if a subject needs more attention.
