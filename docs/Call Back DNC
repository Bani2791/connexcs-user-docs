 In today's society, especially when dialling the UK, it is important that you recognise the Do Not Call Lists (DNC). Calling numbers on
 these lists can result in costly fines and prosecutions. To help you to manage these calls we have created a feature where the numbers 
 can be added to the system and should they be called the caller will receive a message to alert them to the fact that the number is on
 the DNC list. 
 To set this up please follow the instructions below.
