# Vouchers

**Vouchers** allow benefits to be applied when a customer tops-up their account. They are available in both the Customer Portal and in WebPhone. 

## Voucher Types

Vouchers may be issues in one of 3 forms:

* **Free Credit** - Once the voucher code is entered credit is applied independently of any other payment
* **Additional Credit** - Ex: $50 free credit for top-up of $100 or more.
* **Multiplier Credit** - Ex: Credit doubled for top-up of $50 or more.

## Voucher Setup

1. Go to Management > Vouchers.
2. Click on the blue **`Add`** button
  * **Count**- Enter how many vouchers you wish to create (a voucher may only be used once)
  * **Minimum Activation** - Enter the minimum amount the customer must spend before the voucher is valid. Set to ZERO to give a customer completely free credit. 
  * **Multiplier** - Enter the amount to multiple the customer's paid balance by. Ex: for a 10% bonus, set the voucher to 1.1.
  * **Addition** - Enter how much extra credit to be applied to the customer's account. Ex: Set $50 to give them $50, with or without a spend of their own, based on the Minimum Activation.
  * **Currency Selector** - Select the desired currency

3. Select **`Save`** and the system will generate the vouchers.
