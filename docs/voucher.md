# Vouchers
**Management :material-menu-right: Vouchers**

**Vouchers** are similar to calling cards, with the optional benefit of applying additional credits when a customer tops-up their account. **Vouchers** are available in both the Customer Portal and in WebPhone. 

## Voucher Types

Vouchers may be issues in one of 3 forms:

* **Free Credit** - Once the voucher code is entered credit is applied independently of any other payment.
* **Multiplier Credit** - Ex: Credit doubled for top-up of $50 or more.
* **Additional Credit** - Ex: $50 free credit for top-up of $100 or more.


## Voucher Setup
Click on the blue **`Add`** button.

* **Count**: Enter how many vouchers you wish to create (a voucher may only be used once)
* **Minimum Activation**: Enter the minimum amount the customer must spend before the voucher is valid. Set to '0' to give a customer completely free credit. 
* **Multiplier**: Enter the amount to multiple the customer's paid balance by. Ex: for a 10% bonus, set the voucher to 1.1.
* **Addition**: Enter how much extra credit to be applied to the customer's account. Ex: Set 50 to give them $50, with or without a spend of their own, based on the Minimum Activation.
* **Currency Selector**: Select the desired currency

Select **`Save`** and the system will generate the vouchers.
