# Vouchers
**Management :material-menu-right: Vouchers**

**Vouchers** are similar to calling cards, with the optional benefit of applying additional credits when a customer tops-up their account. **Vouchers** are available in both the Customer Portal and in WebPhone. 

## Voucher Types

You can issue Vouchers in one of the following 3 forms:

* **Free Credit** - Once you enter the voucher code, credit is applied independently of any other payment.
* **Multiplier Credit** - Ex: Credit doubled for top-up of $50 or more.
* **Additional Credit** - Ex: $50 free credit for top-up of $100 or more.
