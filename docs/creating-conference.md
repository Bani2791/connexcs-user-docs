# Creating a Conference Call

You create a conference call when you want to allow multiple callers to communicate with each other over a voice call. The callers who join the call are presided over by a caller known as the 'moderator'. 

!!! info "What you need to change your password" 
   If the maximum number of callers are actively connected to a conference call and there are additional callers waiting to join the conference, the callers who are waiting can join the call when the active callers exit the call.   

!!! question "How do I ask callers to join the conference" 
    Use the email or messaging services to specify the exact time and day the call must start, the duration of the call, and the pass codes the callers and the moderator must use to join the call. Your callers can use this conference setup until the details of this conference are deleted from the ConnexCS Control Panel. 

!!! question "How can I use the keypad to control the audio on the conference call?"
    Use the following keypad options for the conference calls you create on the ConnexCS Control Panel.
    
    |Keypad option|Result|Description|
    |-------|------|------|
    |0|mute|mute your microphone. The other callers cannot hear you.|
    |1|vol talk down|decrease the volume (sensitivity) of your microphone, by 1 unit.|
    |2|vol talk zero|reset the volume (sensitivity) of your microphone to the default value.|
    |3|vol talk up|increase the volume (sensitivity) of your  microphone by 1 unit. The other callers hear you louder.|
