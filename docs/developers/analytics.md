# Analytics

The **Analytics** section is a powerful tool for gathering, manipulating, and displaying data. This is where all reports and graphs are built. You can view and modify a wide range of existing reports or create your own. Data can also be run through Script Forge using processing techniques such as mapreduce and preProcess function.
