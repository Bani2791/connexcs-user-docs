# Button Builder
**Developer :material-menu-right: Button Builder**

**Button Builder** is used in combination with [**Form Builder**](https://docs.connexcs.com/developers/form-builder/) to create a button which can be placed in an existing menu on the site.

!!! example "Example use"
    Create the ability to select 1 or more customers/DIDs, supplement with additional information gathered from a form, then run Script Forge to either send that data outside the system or perform bulk operations which may need to be repeated.

## Create new Button
Click the **`+`** and complete the following fields:

+ **Label** - Enter the button label (what it will say).
+ **Icon** - Select an icon to display.
+ **Type / Colour** - Select the button colour.
+ **Placement** - This selection will display the button at the top of the Customers list, Carriers list, or Invoices.
+ **ScriptForge** - Choose the Script Forge (if any) to run when the button is clicked.
+ **Forms** - Choose the form (if any) to display when the button is clicked, which will pass the data over to the chosen Script Forge.
+ **Min / Max Select** - No selection means the button is available when selecting no records. Entering limits will set mix/max limits to the selection.

Click **`Save`** to make the new Button available for placement.
