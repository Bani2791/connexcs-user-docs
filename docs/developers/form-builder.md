# Form Builder

**Form Builder** allows developers to create customized forms for their VoIP systems. The tool provides an easy way to automate information gathering and other activities through form building by integrating with your portal and Script Forge. This is configured under **Management** > **Developer** > **Form Builder**.

## Create a Form

1. Enter a **Name** for the form (consider naming conventions for organizational purposes down the road).
2. Select the desired **Script Forge** script from the drop-down menu.
3. Use **Placement** to select where the form is deployed.
4. Drag the item from the left section to the grey area.

5. Fill in the form and click **`Save`**.
6. Check the form appearance using the **`Preview`** button.

!!! example "Number Porting"
    Create a form for port requests and set the Placement for the Customer Portal. Customers can then submit the port request, with all required information (including items like customer internal ticket number). Internally you can create a ticket with this request for the carrier.
