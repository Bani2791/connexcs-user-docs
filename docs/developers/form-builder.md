# Form Builder

**Form Builder** allows developers to create customized form documents for their VoIP systems, either through a customer portal or in ScriptForge. The tool provides an easy way to generate any type of form, integrate it with your portal, or ScriptForge, and start collecting information. 

## Create a Form
1. Under **Management** > **Developer** > **Form Builder**, click the **`+`** button.
4. Enter a **Name** for the form (consider naming conventions for organizational purposes down the road).
5. Select the desired **ScriptForge** script from the drop-down menu.
6. Use **Placement** to select where the form is deployed.
7. Drag the item from the left section to the grey area.
