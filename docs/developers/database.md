# Database
**Developer :material-menu-right: Database**

The **Database** allows you to create custom persistent data storage. A datastore can be specific to a single customer or global (used with any customer).

The **Database** is used for activities like checking list of numbers, caching external lookups, or creating stateful applications that provide users a set number of free minutes per month.

## Types
Preset data storage options are:

+ **Key / Value** - Contains a basic Key / Value Storage.

+ **Lead Set** - Contains the most common fields when using a datastore for customer / campaign data which are used with dialers.

## Bulk Upload

You can bulk upload data and bulk delete data from the datastore, both from the customer portal and the control panel.

!!! important
	Bulk Operations aren't audited.
