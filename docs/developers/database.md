# Database
Developer :material-menu-right: Database

The **Database** allows you to create custom persistent data storage. A datastore can be global (used with any customer), or it can be associated with a single customer.
The **Database** can be used for activities such as checking a list of numbers, caching external lookups, or creating stateful applications that allow users a certain amount of free minutes per month.

## Types
There are two preset data storage options:

* **Key / Value** - Contains a basic Key / Value Storage.
* **Lead Set** - Contains the most common fields when using datastore for customer / campaign data which can be used with diallers.

## Bulk Upload

It is possible to bulk upload data and bulk delete data from the datastore. Both from the customer portal and the control panel.

!!! important
	Bulk Operations are not audited.
