# Changing a User's Password

You can change a user's password (used to log into the ConnexCS Control Panel) if the user has forgotten the password. To change the password, you do not need to know the user's current password.

!!! question "How should I inform the user about the password change?" 
    When you change a user's password, the ConnexCS Control Panel does not send the new password to the user. You must email or text the new password to the user.

To change a user's password:

1.  Log into the ConnexCS Control Panel.
    
    ConnexCS Control Panel displays the page you were on when you logged out of the Control Panel.
    
2.  Click 'Setup > Settings > User' in the navigation panel (located on the left of the page).
    
    The Users and Groups page appears.
    
    You can see the list of users on the left of the page, and the list of groups on the right of the page.
