    goto: call-found-but-wont-connect
  - text: No
    answer: There is a strong possibility that the call has not reached the switch. It is best to check the client config to confirm that calls are being sent out. If you are unsure or are unable to confirm that it was sent out, try to obtain a packet capture from the senders side.
