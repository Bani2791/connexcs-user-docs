You need to give the alert a name such as: Low Balance Alert,

Next select the email address or phone number to whom you wish the alert to go to,

The Area is the place that is being monitored ie Balance,

The Operator is the comparitor to which the threshold is compared. If the Operator is set to eg >$50 and the Threshold is set to $50 then the Alert will be triggered and sent out to the recipient.

Click "Save" and a new alert will be created.
