# Alerts

The last tab is the “Alerts” tab. It allows you to generate alerts to your customers when some specific events are triggered. You can view all your alerts by clicking on this tab.

You can also add a customised alert by clicking on the “+” sign.

You need to give the alert a name such as: Low Balance Alert,

Next select the email address or phone number to whom you wish the alert to go to,

The Area is the place that is being monitored ie Balance,

The Operator is the comparitor to which the threshold is compared. If the Operator is set to eg >$50 and the Threshold is set to $50 then the Alert will be triggered and sent out to the recipient.

Click “Save” and a new alert will be created.
