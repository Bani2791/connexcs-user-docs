In a Customer Rate Card, it is possible to set a routing strategy. At the moment the functionility is basic, you can only select between LCR, Random, Round Robin, Reverse LCR.

This allows you to change the default behaviour of a card, it looses priority against routing strategy, if a rule is set in here routing strategy, it ignores anything set in customer card.
