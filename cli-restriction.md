<h2>CLI Restriction</h2>

CLI Restriction enables you to pass a CLI which is presented on the customer's account. Anything without a valid CLI will not be passed through.

Checking the Force CLI option will let the user to pass the CLI without having to set the CLI at customer's end.

<b>Note:</b> If no CLI rules are added just the default CLI which is presented by your end customer will pass through. Also we do support regular expression.
